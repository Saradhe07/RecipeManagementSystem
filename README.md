# 🍽️ Recipe Management System (OOP-Based)
A simple Python console application built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project allows users to add, view, and search recipes, organized into Veg and Non-Veg categories.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how OOP concepts such as Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Encapsulation can be applied to build clean, modular, and maintainable Python code.

# 🚀 Features

-Add new recipes (Veg / Non-Veg)

-View all available recipes

-Search recipes by name

-Well-structured OOP-based design

-Simple and beginner-friendly console interface

# 🧠 OOP Concepts Used
1️⃣ Abstraction

o An abstract base class Recipe defines the common structure for all recipes.

o Uses Python’s abc module to enforce method implementation.

2️⃣ Inheritance

o VegRecipe and NonVegRecipe classes inherit from the base Recipe class.

3️⃣ Polymorphism

o Each child class provides its own implementation of the display_recipe() method.

4️⃣ Encapsulation

o RecipeManager class manages recipe data internally.

o Recipes can only be accessed or modified using class methods.

5️⃣ Class & Object

o Recipes are represented as objects created from their respective classes.
